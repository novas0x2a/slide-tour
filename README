This is an engine designed for tour programs. It's somewhat comparable to
Myst's engine, except that this doesn't support interaction with the
environment.

This was originally written for my CS senior thesis at WPI. I've put a little
love into it since then, but not a lot. I like what it does, though, so I'll
probably work on it some more.

If you want to see it in action, you need some data. The data I used for my
thesis is here: http://slide-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/wpi-tour-1.0.zip. Put it in
the same directory as the binary (you don't need to unzip it)
